                    <h3>Why take AP&reg;?</h3>
                    <p>My job is to provide you with the best preparation possible for college. By taking AP classes, you are taking a big jump into the college experience. 
                       You are being exposed to college level work, exams, and time management. Not only does it help with this, you also have the oppertunity to take the AP
                       exam in may to potentially get college credit so you do not have to take these entry level college classes when you get there!</p>

                    <h3>What has AP has done for me?</h3>
                    
                    <p>Although I am a Junior here at Citrus Valley High School, I understand what the average student goes through. Even though I haven't graduated yet,
                       I know that I put AP to work for me because I realize that I don't have to take these classes when I actually get to college. I have already taken three AP classes:
                        AP Chemistry, AP Language and Composition, and AP United States History. Not only have I taken a deeper understanding in all of these concepts, they have positively
                        altered my future of what I want as a career for the better.
