                        college level course material. All AP classes are certified by the <a href="https://collegeboard.org" id="ever" target="_blank">College 
                        Board</a>, who oversee the Advanced Placement Program. They have the final say on which schools get to bear the "AP&reg;" stamp

                    <h3>Why take AP&reg;?</h3>
                    <h4><p>My job is to provide you with the best preparation possible for college. By taking AP classes, you are taking a big jump into the college experience. 
                       You would be exposed to college level work, exams, and time management. And these aren't the only benefits, you also have the opertunity to take the AP
                       exam(s) in May to potentially get college credit so you do not have to take these entry level college classes when you get there!</p></h4>

                    <h3>What has AP done for me?</h3>
                    
                    <h4><p>Although I am a Junior here at Citrus Valley High School, I understand the average student workload. Even though I haven't graduated yet,
                       I know that I put AP to work for me because I realize that I don't have to take these classes when I actually get to college. I have already taken three AP classes:
                        AP Chemistry, AP Language and Composition, and AP United States History. Not only have they given me a richer understanding in learning, they have positively
                        altered my future of what I want as a career for the better.
