                    <h4><p>The regular, everyday classes that make you happy should be your top choices for the AP classes you want.
                       Remember: you are taking AP classes because you are committed to a college class that you feel you are
                       ready for. Do a little soul searching: Do you like science? Consider taking AP Chemistry or AP Biology. What about that love for
                       math that you have? Maybe you can handle AP Calculus AB/BC or AP Statistics. Do you have a passion for
                       drawing? Look into AP Art History. Keep reading below to see just some of the classes that are available. The possibilities are
                       almost endless when thinking about taking AP because the choices seem almost endless!</p></h4>
